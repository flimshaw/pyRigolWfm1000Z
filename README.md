# Rigol DS1000Z series oscilloscopes waveform library & utilities for Python 3.4

*Important! This library can not calculate correct voltage values from raw data. I could not (yet?) locate all the data necessary to do that in the WFM files. Use --raw parameter to use raw data for plots and CSV files. Any help with file format is welcome!*

*Important! WFM file format differs with firmware versions, 00.04.01.SP2 and 00.04.02.SP4 (the most recent when writing this on 03/01/2015 which fixes jitter issues) are currently supported, others are untested.*

These scripts are based on the [pyRigolWFM](https://github.com/mabl/pyRigolWFM) by Matthias Blaicher and my reverse engineering of Rigol DS1054Z WFM files.
They include a library for reading DS1000Z WFM files and extracting some basic data from them and a utility for plotting and conversion of the WFM file data to other formats.

The library has been tested with Rigol DS1054Z but hopefully also works with other oscilloscopes from the DS1000Z series.

Additionally an application wfmutil.py is included which provides (See wfmutil.py -h and wfmutil.py <action> -h for parameter descriptions):

 - Printing information about the WFM file
 - Export of WFM data in JSON format
 - Export of WFM data in CSV format
 - Export of WFM data in VCD (Value Change Dump) format
 - Export of WFM data in Atmel Studio 6 stimuli file format  
 - Interactive plotting of the waveform including an FFT (--fft option)(plotting requires scipy, numpy and matplotlib libraries)

## Not supported
 - Voltage calculation from raw data - there is some voltage calculaction code, but it is not functional and produces wrong results except specific cases.
 - Logic analyser (my DS1054Z doesn't have one)
 - Any settings not printed in the following example output are not (yet?) supported
 
## VCD and AS6 stimuli files
As logic analyser is not supported, logic values for VCD and AS6 stimuli files are calculated from raw data of analog channels by simply comparing them to a threshold value (by default 128) common to all the channels (separate threshold values and automatic calculation of threshold values to be done). 
This simple method may not be optimal, but is OK for clean signals.

## Examples
